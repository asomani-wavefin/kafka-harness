# Kafka Developer Harness

_v0.1.0 - Updated 31 October 2022_

This is inteded to be a quick start project to jump start local Kafka development. It includes the following components:

1. Launch a containerized local Kafka server + Zookeeper environment.
2. Simple Kafka producer that pushes fake messages into a topic.
3. Simple Kafka consumer that consumes available messages from a topic. (_coming soon_)

## Requirements
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

```./scripts/kafka-server-ctl.sh```

* Shut down the kafka server stack<br/>
```./scripts/kafka-server-ctl.sh down```

* Run the kafka server stack in detached mode<br/>
```./scripts/kafka-server-ctl.sh up -d```

### Kafka producer
* Test the producer<br/>
```make test```

```python3 -m producer --verbose```

* Help options for producer<br/>

## Tools
* [kcat CLI (formerly kafkacat)](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat) for testing and debuging Apache KafkaÂ® deployments. [Learn how to use it with Confluent](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/app-development/kafkacat-usage.html#kcat-formerly-kafkacat-utility).
